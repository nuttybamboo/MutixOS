Well, MutixOS is a Multi-core Operating System. I hope it will be stable as wellas efficiently running. 
It has multiple independent cores, and the crashing of one of the cores would not affect others' work, that's why it's stable. And compared with the Mini-core OS its main part worked in core mode, thus, its more efficient than the Mini-core OS.
