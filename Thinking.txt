main parts:
1) task scheduling (PM)
2) file system  (FS)
3) virturl memory system (MM)
4) process communication (IPC)
5) rescue moudle
// 6) sand box  (I/O management)
and develope order was almost from 1) to 6)....

One problem for fether thinking: 
weather to set a system call interface to receive all the system calls and then distributed to each module...

3 levels:
r0: 5)
r1: 1) 2) 3) 4)
r3: applacations... maybe 6)..

every parts has it own stack and memory space...

what makes a OS unstable is the I/O drive...thus we isolated it in the sandbox...
